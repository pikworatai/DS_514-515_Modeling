# Pizza Delivery Prediction
Description Modeling: ทำนายโอกาสในการเกิด Order Delayed
## Problem
- Delivery times vary across pizza stores, and some locations exceed the standard delivery time (over 30 minutes), leading to customer dissatisfaction. We want to identify the factors that contribute to delayed deliveries in order to improve service quality, increase delivery speed, and optimize workforce planning both in the kitchen and in the delivery operations.

## Objective
- Reduce the percentage of delayed deliveries from 20% to 10% within 3 months by analyzing the key factors that contribute to delays and developing a predictive model using real order data, in order to enhance service quality and improve workforce planning efficiency.
